# hw9-readMeGenerator

This assignment was to create a README generator using the command line prompts. I was able to create the needed files, and also get everything to console log to the command line. HOwever, I was unsuccessful in getting it to fully generate the new file with the README from the user input. I will continue to attempt getting this to work correctly.
